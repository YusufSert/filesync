### PGM FILE SYNC

# üöÄ Service Description

This service synchronizes files between a standard **FTP server (not SFTP)** and the local file system, which may include Windows shared directories. It is implemented as a **concurrent application** with two dedicated threads:

- üîΩ **Download thread**: synchronizes files from the FTP server to the local file system.
- üîº **Upload thread**: synchronizes files from the local file system back to the FTP server.

These threads run concurrently to enable efficient, bidirectional file synchronization between the FTP server and the local environment.

‚úÖ **To ensure reliability**:

- üîé The service **monitors each thread‚Äôs health and progress**. If a thread **crashes** or **becomes unresponsive** (e.g., takes too long to process), it will automatically terminate the thread and start a new sync thread to continue synchronization without manual intervention.
- üîÅ **Retry and exponential backoff patterns** are used when errors occur (e.g., network issues, temporary FTP failures) to make the service more resilient and minimize the risk of permanent failures due to transient problems.

| üîß **Parameter**      | üìù **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **addr**             | The FTP server address or hostname where the service connects to synchronize files.                  |
| **user**             | Username credential for authenticating with the FTP server.                                          |
| **password**         | Password credential corresponding to the FTP user.                                                   |
| **dbConnStr**        | Database connection string used by the service to connect to the database.                            |
| **networkBasePath**  | The root local network path or directory from which files are synchronized.                          |
| **networkToUploadPath** | Directory path for files to be uploaded from local to FTP.                                        |
| **networkOutgoingPath** | Directory path on the local system where files are moved after successfully being uploaded.        |
| **networkIncomingPath** | Directory path for files incoming to the local system.                                             |
| **ftpWritePath**     | The directory path on the FTP server where files will be uploaded.                                   |
| **ftpReadPath**      | The directory path on the FTP server from which files will be downloaded.                            |
| **poolInterval**     | Time interval (e.g., 5s for 5 seconds) between synchronization cycles or polling attempts.           |
| **heartbeatInterval** | Time interval (e.g., 1s for 1 second) used to send heartbeat signals for monitoring thread health or service status. |
| **logFilePath**      | File path where logs will be written. The file will be created automatically if it does not exist.    |
| **logLevel**         | Logging verbosity level (e.g., -4), controlling the amount of detail in logs.                        |
| **lokiPushURL**      | URL endpoint of a Loki server to which logs are pushed for centralized logging.                      |

# Build Instructions

## Clone the repository form TFS
```bash
git clone http://kctfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/Benefit4C/_git/PGM
```

## Install Go 1.24

## Run commands below for debendencies
```bash
 go mod download
```

## 1. Build for Linux

Run the following command to build the Linux version of the service.  
The output binary will be placed in the `bin` directory with the name `pgmsync`:

```bash
go build -o bin/pgmsync ./cmd/linuxservice/main.go
```

## 2. Build for Windows
Run the following command to cross-compile the Windows version of the service.
The output executable will be named pgmsync.exe and placed in the bin directory

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/pgmsync.exe ./cmd/windowsservice/main.go
```
## 3. Build for Docker
Build your Go application inside a Docker container to ensure a consistent and reproducible build environment.

```bash
cd <where docker file located>
docker build -t pgmsync:0.1 .
dockerun run --name pgmsync -v <config.yml inside host>:/<config.yml inside container>:ro  --resatart unless-stopped pgmsync:0.1 \
-config.path=<bind config file>
```

## Grafana and Loki

Our Grafana dashboard is currently accessible at:

http://172.26.98.110:3000/

At present, user authentication is handled directly by Grafana‚Äôs built-in authentication system.

In the future, we plan to enhance security by integrating LDAP authentication, enabling centralized user management and streamlined access control.
